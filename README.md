# CS-230-Operating-Platforms

- Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
    
    The Gaming Room client is wanting the hire our services to expand a current game application "Draw It or Lose It". This game was originally created for Android systems. This game consists of four rounds of play lasting one minute each. Drawings are rendered at a steady rate and are fully complete at the 30-second mark. The Game Room is interested in expanding their game app to multiple platforms.
    
- What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
  
  I believe that my strongest section on the software design document was the Evaluation section.
    
- What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
  
  The Executive Summary and the requirements section gave me clear insight to what The Gaming Room wanted from the program. The Domain Model gives a clear map of the classes, variable names and methods to follow.
  
- If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
  
  I would choose thew Recommendations section of the document to revise. I would improve it by getting input from other members of the team, and mentors that probably have more experience than me in recommending what to construct an application like this with due to the fact that they have probably done an application like this in the past.
  
- How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
    
    I based the user’s needs from the needs stated in The Gaming Room documentation, subjects learned in this class, and prior experiences. Then needs were defined in the requirements section of the software design document then added to the code that was partially completed. It is important to consider the user’s needs because this will be the main users of this application and if the needs of the user are not meet The Gaming Room would not have a customer base, so in turn would not make a profit from their game application.
    
- How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
  
  I approached the designing of this application based off of the requirements put forth by the Gaming Room. Techniques and strategies that I would use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application would be to use prior knowledge gained from this course and researching similar applications. Before starting the first line of code I would be sure that I have completed a software design document and a Class UML diagram being that these are good guides to make sure you do not do unneeded work.
